### React with Typescript

In this repo, I've worked on a Pomodoro Timer using React and Typescript, it's a simple project, but it requires somewhat a good deal of logic to handle.
React works really well with Typescript, one of the things that felt awkward while working with ReactJS was Prop Typing, and, with TS, we have interfaces to type all that out of the gate, so they work really well witch each other. And since TS gives our IDE super powers, we can even see when we're passing a wrongly typed prop or not passing it at all.
